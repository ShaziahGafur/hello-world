# hello-world

Greetings Earthlings!

I come from planet Jupiter and am here on Earth for a 2-week stay. I am here to convince you to leave your habitat and come live with us. Our tacos are far better than the ones I've tasted here. Our planet is also far more technologically advanced than here. We provide unlimited Li-Fi for your first 3 months. Consider my offer, you'll thank me later.

Yours Truly, 
Dr. Kleik'uwea
